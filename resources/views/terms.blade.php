            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>Welcome to ServiceConnect. The terms and conditions listed below shall apply to you if you use our platform. Please review them carefully.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">User Responsibilities</h2>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">a. Seekers</h3>
            <p>You are responsible for clearly defining your service request to provide clarity for your provider. You agree to communicate respectfully and professionally with providers.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">b. Providers</h3>
            <p>It is your duty to do the task by the dates and conditions specified by the seeker. You commit to speaking with the seeker in a courteous and competent manner.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Liability and Disputes</h2>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">a. Liability</h3>
            <p>Any problems, disagreements, or conflicts that develop between customers and independent contractors during or after a project are not the responsibility of ServiceConnect.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">b. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Issues can be reported by users on our site. After reviewing these reports, we could suspend, warn, or permanently ban users from the platform, among other necessary measures.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">c. Communications and Agreements</h3>
            <p>The seeker and the provider are the parties to all communications and agreements. ServiceConnect disclaims all liability for the integrity, correctness, timeliness, and legality of work completed by independent providers.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is something that we take very seriously. With the exception of situations where disclosure to third parties is mandated by law, all personal information you give on our platform will be kept private and confidential.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Payments</h2>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">a. Payment Transactions</h3>
            <p>Payment transactions take place outside of the purview of ServiceConnect. Seekers and providers must agree on payment terms independently. The agreed-upon amount or price specified within the system should be followed by both users.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">b. Payment Conditions</h3>
            <p>Payment conditions need to be agreed upon separately both seekers and providers. We advise utilizing dependable and safe payment options.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Account Termination</h2>
            <p>If you breach these terms and conditions or take part in any conduct that we determine to be improper or detrimental to the platform or its users, ServiceConnect retains the right to suspend or cancel your account at our discretion and without prior notice.</p>
            
            <p class="mt-6">By using ServiceConnect, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions, acknowledge that you have read them, and understand them.</p>
